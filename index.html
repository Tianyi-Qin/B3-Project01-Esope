    <h2>The Wolf And The Lamb</h2>

    <div class="text-content">

      <p>WOLF, meeting with a Lamb astray from the fold, resolved not to lay violent hands on him, but to find some plea to justify to the Lamb the Wolf’s right to eat him. He thus addressed him:</p> <p>“Sirrah, last year you grossly insulted me.”</p>
      <p>“Indeed,” bleated the Lamb in a mournful tone of voice,</p>
      <p>“I was not then born.” Then said the Wolf,</p>
      <p>“You feed in my pasture.”</p>
      <p>“No, good sir,” replied the Lamb, “I have not yet tasted grass.”</p>
      <p>Again said the Wolf, “You drink of my well.”</p>
      <p>“No,” exclaimed the Lamb, “I never yet drank water, for as yet my mother’s milk is both food and drink to me.”</p>
      <p>Upon which the Wolf seized him and ate him up, saying, “Well! I won’t remain supperless, even though you refute every one of my imputations.”</p>

      <p class="fable-moral">The tyrant will always find a pretext for his tyranny.</p>

    <h2>The Bat And The Weasels</h2>

    <div class="main-content">
      <div class="text-content">

        <p>A BAT who fell upon the ground and was caught by a Weasel pleaded to be spared his life. The Weasel refused, saying that he was by nature the enemy of all birds. The Bat assured him that he was not a bird, but a mouse, and thus was set free. Shortly afterwards the Bat again fell to the ground and was caught by another Weasel, whom he likewise entreated not to eat him. The Weasel said that he had a special hostility to mice. The Bat assured him that he was not a mouse, but a bat, and thus a second time escaped.</p>
        <p class="fable-moral">It is wise to turn circumstances to good account.</p>

    <h2>The Ass And The Grasshopper</h2>
    <div class="main-content">

      <p>AN ASS having heard some Grasshoppers chirping, was highly enchanted; and, desiring to possess the same charms of melody, demanded what sort of food they lived on to give them such beautiful voices. They replied, “The dew.”</p>
      <p class="fable-moral">The Ass resolved that he would live only upon dew, and in a short time died of hunger.</p>

    <h2>The Lion And The Mouse</h2>

    <div class="text-content">
      <p>A LION was awakened from sleep by a Mouse running over his face. Rising up angrily, he caught him and was about to kill him, when the Mouse piteously entreated, saying:</p>
      <p>“If you would only spare my life, I would be sure to repay your kindness.”</p>
      <p>The Lion laughed and let him go. It happened shortly after this that the Lion was caught by some hunters, who bound him by strong ropes to the ground. The Mouse, recognizing his roar, came and gnawed the rope with his teeth, and set him free, exclaiming:</p>
      <p>“You ridiculed the idea of my ever being able to help you, not expecting to receive from me any repayment of your favor; now you know that it is possible for even a Mouse to confer benefits on a Lion.”</p>
      <p class="fable-moral">A kindness is never wasted.</p>
